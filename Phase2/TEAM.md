# Team Contract
1. Everyone be nice to each other.
2. Only sexy code allowed.
3. Finish your code by agreed deadlines.
4. Help others if you finish your code more quickly.
5. Share profits if we monetize.
6. No smelly code. Febreeze that garbage. (Only said garbage to be funny, not to be mean)

**Note: We admit we forgot to update our meetings and associated minutes onto the team markdown
files, these summaries were created post-meeting, and the MEETING.txt files were copy and pasted
from my Notepad where I had taken quick jot notes during meetings for design notes, finished tasks,
and TODOS.**
