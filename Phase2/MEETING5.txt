# Meeting 5 minutes
- Start of a new phase!
- Identified residue issues and bugs from phase 1 we needed to resolve (scoreboard updating issues, clearing up class
and code structure)
- Possible design patterns to use for phase 2? Discussion on whether or not we wanted to shift away from the SlidingTile
structure -> unanimously yes, there must be better ways to organize
- Divided tasks up very roughly, ~2 people per game, 1 person on float duty, UI, and additional cross
game functionality like scoreboard
- Brainstormed possible games -> 2 player games are harder because they need AI or some sort of cross-play
capability -> better to use pre-existing resources like the gridview for games
