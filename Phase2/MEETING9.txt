#Meeting 9 Minutes
- Finished for the large part unittests and troubleshooting -> Minesweeper likely to be the 100% coverage class we present.
- Discussion of process of design and construction -> began work on walkthrough doc -> finish night before phase 2 due date??
- Spent time playing and checking a variety of different button inputs and orderings within games to
try and catch any final extraneous bugs that might have arisen
