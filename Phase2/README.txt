# Welcome to our game center for CSC207 fall 2018 Phase 1.
## We are Lizard King Software LTD aka group_0588.

# To setup the program:
1. Clone ALL files in group_0588 / Phase1 / GameCentre
Including exact gradle scripts:
  *Because under build.gradle (Module: app) we have added implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.0'
2. After that, make sure you are connected to the internet.
  *Because our login and register feature uses a database on a server to store credentials. The website used is one of our member’s personal website. Make sure you can connect to https://kayyzz.com/Register.php and Android studio is not blocked from accessing the internet.
3. Now you should be able to create a Pixel 2 Virtual device running Android 8.1 API 27
4. Run our game
5. You need to Register first by clicking on the “Register Here” text
6. You may have to wait a little after you click Login or Register depending on the speed of the connection to the server.
7. After you login in you will be able to explore our games. We currently only have Sliding Tiles game available.
