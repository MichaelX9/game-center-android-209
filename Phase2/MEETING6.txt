#Meeting 6 minutes
- Decided on 2048 and Minesweeper as our two games -> discussed key points of implementation for each game
    - How are we going to do random mine and tile generation? How exactly do tiles shift in 2048?
    How do we want to do large swatch reveals in minesweeper? Which functions does each game need (undo
    in minesweeper seems unintuitive)
- Began coding on games -> try and follow similar class design structures (controller, model, view deisgn pattern
under heavy consideration for use)
