#Meeting 7 minutes
- Discussed roadblocks in implementation -> Minesweeper coming along swimmingly
    -2048 main algorithm largely worked out, how exactly do we track sliding gestures -> look for
    model code on stackexchange or git for ideas
- Implemented a checker to make sure any generated board for SlidingTiles was solvable -> used parity
and observation of width of grid to determine solvability
- Make sure to have all games finished for next meeting as least in the rough so troubleshooting can
begin
