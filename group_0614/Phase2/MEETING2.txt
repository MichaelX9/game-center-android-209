# Meeting 2 Minutes
- Finish all individual portion assignments on GoogleDoc by Nov 3 for testing and debugging
- Use GameManager superclass -> applicable for all future games
   - We should not use BoardManager to extend this super -> too many non-universal methods
   - Design a second Manager class for game management and common features -> save, load, undo, etc.
- Login and Register screen functionality through Kevin's website?
- Finished CRC flashcards -> Kevin has them
   - General gist is userData (username, scores, boards, etc.) kept altogether in GameManager
   - Build activities around that structure -> see how well everything integrates
